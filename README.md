# Intel - Image Scene classification by VGG16
Goal of this project is to classify the image scene, the way i used was deep learning by Keras.</br>
Run place: Google Colab

## Data Processing
* Combine data
* Use "train_test_split" to split data (Training and validation data)

## Train model
* Use Tensorflow Keras application - VGG16 (Without training weights of model)
* Open closed layers and training these layers's weights

## Result
The accuracy of no-trained-weight model is about 91%, as for trained-weight model, it achieve about 93%.
